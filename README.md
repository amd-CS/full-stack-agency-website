# full-stack-agency-website

This is a full-stack website for a tourism agency. The website consists of four pages. Users can send comments which are stored in the database and shown on the page as well. 
The website design is responsive with a mobile-first approach. The use of advanced CSS layouts and flat colors has made the website modern-looking and minimal.
The form for sending comments uses jQuery for client-side validation and PHP for server-side validation.
